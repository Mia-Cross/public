HOW TO INSTALL AND CONFIGURE THE 42 VM

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GOOD TO KNOW ABOUT THE VM :
- Username = user42 ; password = user42
- You can't use the numeric keypad
- Copy/Paste from/in a document, a browser, etc = CTRL+C / CTRL+V
- Copy/Paste from/in a terminal = CTRL+SHIFT+C / CTRL+SHIFT+V
- If you switch to fullscreen mode, take note of the displayed message because it contains the set of keys needed to get out of this mode.
It's different depending on the computer (on the school macs = left 'command' key + 'F')

0. Before you begin

	0.0. Have your own directory in sgoinfre (only if you're installing on school macs)
mkdir /sgoinfre/goinfre/Perso/my_login
chmod 700 /sgoinfre/goinfre/Perso/my_login (prevents other users from accessing your directory)
NB : this directory is persistent, unlike the goinfre it doesn't clear itself, so you will be able to keep your VM and access it from any station.

	0.1. Have VirtualBox installed
MacOS : In the MSC (Managed Software Center) : Install VirtualBox
Linux : https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads

------

1. Download and import the VM

$INSTALL_PATH :
 - On school macs = "/sgoinfre/goinfre/Perso/my_login/"
 - At home : any directory with at least 10Go free, 20Go will be even better.

	1.0. Download the image
curl http://vm-42.s3.fr-par.scw.cloud/xubuntu-42.ova --output $INSTALL_PATH/xubuntu-42.ova
/!\ If this step fails it can be because the url is outdated. In this case just look for the new link on Slack or Discord.
	1.1. Open the image in VirtualBox
open $INSTALL_PATH/xubuntu-42.ova
/!\ If this step fails, it might be because VirtualBox is not installed.
	1.2. Configure a storage path for the VM
Modify the path to $INSTALL_PATH, either by typing it directly, or by selecting 'Other' and browse.
Click Import

------

2. Start the VM

In VirtualBox, select "xubuntu" in the left pannel.
Click on the green arrow Start
Once it's started, if the screen stays black, try and shrink the window until you see the logging screen appear.
At the top right of the screen, you should be able to change the language.
Log in using user42 credentials.

------

3. Set up the VM

Access Parameters :
In the VM, in the top left corner of the screen, click the little blue mouse.
Select 'Settings' in the right pannel.

	3.0. Change screen size
Settings > Display
Select the best resolution (on school macs, the ones that start with 1920 are quite good)
Apply
	3.1. Change keyboard layout (if necessary)
Settings > Keyboard
In the 'Layout' tab, disable default settings.
Add the keyboard you wish to use.
Delete the default keyboard (otherwise changes won't be made)
Close
	3.2. Share the clipboard : you'll need it to be able to copy/paste between the VM and your computer.
In the VirtualBox menu bar (at the top of the screen, outside of the VM window) :
Click on Devices > Insert Guest Additions CD image (loads a virtual CD on the Desktop)
Open a terminal in the VM (Terminator or right-click on Desktop > 'open a terminal'), and type :
	sudo /media/user42/VBox_GAs_6.0.14/autorun.sh
Restart the VM >> see step 4
Open a terminal int the VM again and type :
	sudo sh Documents/install.sh
There you go, the VM should now be all set :)

------

4. Shut down or Restart the VM

	4.0. EITHER with VirtualBox:
Close the window and choose between :
- 'Power off the machine' = Shuts down the VM, if you have properly saved your work, you won't lose anything.
- 'Save the machine state' = Makes the VM inactive, at start up you will find everything the way you left it.
/!\ If you need to restart the VM to apply come changes, don't select 'Save the state' because it doesn't shut down.
	4.1. OR with Ubuntu:
The classic way, click the little blue mouse et select the on/off button at the bottom right of the menu.
